IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

JOHN DOE, PETITIONER v. JANE ROE, RESPONDENT

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 15, 2023]

CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question of whether artificial intelligence systems
can be considered authors under the Copyright Act of 1976. We hold that
while AI systems may generate creative works, they lack the human
authorship required for copyright protection under current law.

I

The Copyright Act extends protection to "original works of authorship"
fixed in any tangible medium of expression. 17 U. S. C. ยง102(a). The
term "authorship" has historically been understood to require human
creativity, as evidenced by the Constitution's Copyright Clause, which
empowers Congress to secure to "authors" the exclusive right to their
"writings." Art. I, ยง8, cl. 8.

Petitioner, an AI researcher, argues that his AI system, "CreativeMind,"
should be recognized as the author of a novel it generated. The system
was trained on millions of books and can produce original stories based
on simple prompts. However, the Copyright Office denied registration,
finding that the work lacked human authorship.

II

The fundamental question before us is whether the term "author" in the
Copyright Act includes non-human entities. We hold that it does not.

A

Our precedent has consistently linked authorship with human creativity.
In Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U. S. 53 (1884), we
explained that an "author" is "he to whom anything owes its origin." Id.,
at 58. While this definition is broad, it has always been understood in
the context of human creativity.

B

The Copyright Act's legislative history further supports this
interpretation. The 1976 Act was designed to protect the fruits of
intellectual labor that are founded in the creative powers of the human
mind. There is no indication that Congress intended to extend protection
to works generated by machines.

III

Our holding today does not diminish the value or potential of AI-generated
works. Rather, it recognizes that the current copyright framework was not
designed to address this new technology. If copyright protection for
AI-generated works is desirable as a matter of policy, it is for Congress
to determine the appropriate scope of such protection.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
